That means employees get to wear several hats, interact with staff more often and are afforded a 360-degree view of company-wide operations. Because employees have more visibility, it is often easier to advance in a smaller organization.Another benefit is that employees often gain experience in a variety of areas, giving them multiple skills and areas of expertise to enhance their resume. Small firms may also have more flexibility when it comes to considering alternative work arrangements such as flextime and job sharing. Working for a small company can also be a good stepping-stone to a larger employer in the same field.","On the downside, small firms may have fewer formal training programs and their benefits packages can be more limited.

Considerably good growth. But I don't see this as a negative point because these 10 yrs you simply did some crap work nobody cared. Now, you don't have any technical skills, but you can do some crap work on whatever project you are assigned to. so you cannot move out of the company; also the company do not leave you. it's a sentimental employer-employee association.On the other hand, the important disadvantage or issue here is:Now you are a 10 yrs experienced person with 5.8 lakhs salary and your title is sr.tech associate.But at the same time another guy joins your team with 4 yrs experience with 8.2 lakhs salary and with the title same sr.tech associate.

You have to simply beg to people just to get a laptop (for project assigned people only). It was a laugh riot to see one laptop being shared by 4 senior resources.

Analyse this: Management gulped all appraisals for hard working people and they dont even care to send a mail to employees any reason for doing so. There is a leakout in press, just to manipulate share prices but not even a single mail to their employees.3. Take less salary or leave : Yes, this is what has happened.

And during this tenure, i got some really good exposure facing a very big client - AT&T, and also i got decent vertical growth(though i had to really fight for it).2. Onsite rotation policy is being implemented very strictly, this will definitely give opportunities to fresh people.But, still i feel there's a lot of favouritism in favour of Pune location.There are so many people from Pune, that seem to have settled here in US. Why are they not ever rotated?3. There is a really good amount of flexibility. I feel this depends largely on your immediate supervisor.

Good compensation for less experienced people. Very bad for experienced ones, salaries don't increase much, not anywhere close to the industry standards.

Starting 2008, they drastically decreased the US salaries also(even though the dollar rate has been significantly high).2. They behave like slaves of their clients. Top management doesn't think much about negotiating with the client about changing the timings of offshore teams. Continous night shifts. It frustrates people.3. Very poor compensation for night shift and weekend support.4. Variable pay is never given on time. It's July right now, and 25% amount is still pending from Q4 2009-10.5. Very poor cab facility, even though they charge for it.6. Very bad infrastructure at new locations. People don't get the phones with mute buttons. Leaves bad impression on clients.7. Bad quality of people being hired recently. Not many people have good communication skills.8. Company doesn't know how to retain its best employees. Very callous and unprofessional attitude of the top management. Many important and critical people are also leaving the organisation now, which is sad.","1.

One would expect that this would lead management to give better hike but that is simply what 1 would expect. This is all while Tech Mahindra is daily surpassing new highs both in terms of business and share market and as many of my fellow Ex-TechMighty know that this isn't a win for employee. Promotions are questionable and reward policies seems to be a rotational policy most of the time.

This projects are generally of very short duration (around 1.5 yrs-2yrs). Once project is completed, employee is released and put on bench. Now real problem arise here. The RMG(Resource Management Group) people do not help employee in allocation of another project. Employee have to search project on his own(if he has contacts), other wise after 1-2 months also he is project-less. Now another horrifying policy of company comes into picture. Employees are randomly called by HR on any fine day and are asked to resign (else he will be terminated). Overall job security is one biggest factor which is NOT in TechM's dictionary. Even if the person is billable, he is working under fear of getting released/terminated.Appraisals: If person (generally with work experience of more than 4 yrs) is getting C rating, he is asked to resign by HR.Monitoring the employee: In BT projects (which forms major part of TechM projects), they have installed a software called 'Sapience'. This ridiculous s/w is used for policing/monitoring the employee. It tracks how much time employee is spending on project and non-project activities, and also how much time person was at his machine.No new projects: Techm is hugely dependent on BT, which in turn has grown smart and asking TechM to work at very low costs. This in turn is affecting work culture. Comp. is unable to identify newer projects/business since 2-3 years.Other Policies: Support team/HR team is not employee friendly. Sometimes even they do not reply to your mails.Summary: If one want to learn things and move to next company in 1.5-2 yrs, then it is okay to join.

Although it has significant global presence, it is run by Indians for Indians. You need to break in to the 'inner circle' to make progress.Unstructured. The leadership promotes the company as 'Entrepreneurial' which, in my experience, meant that everything was made from scratch with very little standardization. Approvals were based on who you know; processes are designed to be 'bent' when the right support is in place.No clear responsibilities. Everyone is responsible for everything - which in practice means nobody is responsible. Job descriptions and organization charts are very hard to find.Employee engagement. Employees are valued if the leadership perceives that they have done something significant for the business (mostly sales influenced). If you do not fit in this box then you should expect to be treated as a worker bee.","TechM's success today is based on the performance of individual leaders in the company, not on the organization. To achieve the growth that TechM has as a goal, there needs to a change in mindset to productize and standardize the way they operate. There needs to be a cross-pollination of capabilities between internal silos, and the values that the executives preach need to be realized at the lower levels in the company (onshore and offshore.)",Former Employee - Anonymous Employee,Null,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Tech-Mahindra-RVW8296657.htm,2,1,2,4,3

I found that I was sitting for so much, so long, that my lower back was hurting me. The breaks you get (two 15 minutes ones and only a 1/2 hour lunch) barely help much with this grueling work.

4859,empReview_10149649,1, 4 Apr 2016,"PLEASE READ THE FULL REVEIW - Manager centric, mediocre centric, depends fully on your luck that how your manager is","1. Infrastructure and finance team are very helpful, team worked very nicely, at least in Bangalore2. Good exposure to telecom domain, most important domain in business3. Work life balance ..mmm.. ok, lets take that better comparing to worst companies4. They give good package to experienced professionals, because the people who are staying in Tech Mahindra from starting and sticking to the mud, are actually worthless, either completely dumb, or ignorant, or highly egoistic","Now, let me try to put down all the things, so many of them, that I am unable to organize1. NO VISION AT ALL - They don't know what they are looking for, they dont know what they need to do for knowing that, and overall, they don't know what the customer is interested in. They are still in the utopia of 2000 odd time, that customer will eat anything that they serve! Not at all having any vision towards the new trends of business2. COMPLETELY MANAGER CENTRIC - Suppose you have a good manager (which is very rare because the ""Old TechM fools"" are not good at all, and the fresh bloods are very less in numbers in managerial role), then you will sustain.Otherwise,, suppose, your manager does not like you because you like football and he likes cricket ( or any great reason you can think of), the manager will do anything with you, screw your career, dump you, kick you, whatever he likes.3. This adds up to the earlier points, I have thought in this issue for many days, tried to find the reason why this is so? What I found was, the HR and other processes are NULL. No one can do anything if your manager throws you out, there is no process set. Managers are taken as ""revenue generators"" and they are free to do anything they wish with the subordinates, just like a construction ""pimp"" does with the workers. This is complete ""Baniya"" company who counts money before going to sleep, everything else can go to hell!4. Want some more?..ok...lets see if I can be a little polite...please do not show your capabilities in work, only be mediocre and talk big things, dont ever do anything. Because whenever you are doing anything better than the others, the ""Aam Admi"" will pull you down and ruin your career. And the most hilarious point is - your manager will do the same, because he is in constant threat that anyone slightly smart enough can take his position! Wondering how it is possible? Yes it is, because client also does not expect TechM employee to do anything smart, because they have hired cheap labors, so even if your team does not give any super solutions for years, project will sustain. Managers will think - who wants to give unexpected outcomes taking their own career at stake?? So, as you understand, things are like this.5. Wait, please, you have kept your patience till here, so allow me to take 2 minutes more to wrap the things up.Low performers are nowhere wanted in the industry. This is absolutely true, And company should think that how to reduce the cost by removing these low/very low performers, absolutely true. Mind the gap..I am not going to argue about whether or not the employee was actually a low performer, or he has got the rating only due to personal grievance what the manager had on him...both the reasons are valid, and there is no process to verify that, believe me!! I will, for the sake of brevity, assume that the employee was a real ""baaaad"" performer. Now, I have seen what other companies do, they call the employee, give him one month of notice, and tell him to search for job. But, here comes the sweet part - techm HR will call you up, and ask you to resign, and that they will tell you do do in one day!! I have seen people were forced to resign within one hour after HR called him, and...guess what....no notice period...tomorrow is your last day! Funny.. isnt it?","Nothing to tell at all...I dont know why you hire experienced people and ruin their careers when you are actually very well equipped with mediocre, blunt headed, ""YES SIR"" employees, enough in number, to run your day to day business. Please use them, both you and them would be happily living together forever..and let the fairy tale end that way...",Former Employee - Business Analyst,I worked at Tech Mahindra full-time (Less than a year),https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Tech-Mahindra-RVW10149649.htm,3,1,1,3,1

No work culture. Managers are like Hitler they will constantly look onto your system whenever they roam to your work desk. If any employee will would take tea brake with another team mates at pentry then If manager watched that he will surly ask ""Bhaiya Kaam Nahi Hai Kya"" or If after long working hours if some one doing some gossping with another team mates again manager will ask ""Bhaiya Kaam Nahi Kya"" which is the worst thing I faced in this company.2. One more bad policy is you have to complete 9:30 Hrs in the campus including 9 hrs on System for this tracking there is Software in every System which will calculate each day of your timing on system. If you spend less than a min from 9 hrs they will surly deduct your salary of half day.3. If you took lunch for 1 hr again manager will ask you complete your lunch in 20 Mins only , Hah I can't Imagine manager will go this level of cheapness.4. No Outing for Team.5. No self morale & motivation6. Appraisal are the worst they will give you only 1 to 3% only.7. Salary is also very much less as compared to market standard.8. Timing is not flexible If you reach 1/2 hr late then again manager will warn you in arrogant way ""This is my last warning to you"".9. Onsite Opportunity, Only If you know how to butter your manager then this place is heaven for you. So for butternuts, this is the best place.10. My suggestion to all new joiners is ""Think again.

I have moved to another org. I have been to Hyd, Bangalore location of TechM. My training was done in SAP luckily and we were assigned to various projects.Some positives which I feel is worth noting:TechM does have good training infrastructure.Hyd Bahadurpally campus is nice and you may get dorms to stay inside the techM campus. There are separate hostels for boys and girls.The areas nearby provides cheap stays so If you get project in Hyd you can save a lot of money compared to Bangalore.Food inside the campus is cheap and if you stay in dorms, you have a happy life.Bus facility was good.Shift allowance if you have US /UK client. 225 for a day, 400 for a night. If you TL/Manager is cool, you can have easy life like leaving early and work from home.WFH is allowed for night shifts and some cases for women's.","Man, cons are too many. I am writing the big ones which does matter and people do leave techM for these reasons.Not at all employee friendly policies and useless HR dept.You never get hike on time. This year Aug 2016 hike is delayed and my friends in techM are still waiting for hike. Also please note, they never pay any arrear for delay.No good projects in SAP. You have some old big support projects running which is a bad place for a fresher to start. You will learn nothing and would know only after years.SAP technology is sinking in techM and management has done nothing. There is one very huge SAP support project running in Bangalore location where fresher's are being utilized for all works as you just have to do brainless job daily.There are no implementation projects with techm, in any technology.Managers here are mostly very rude and non cooperative. They don't understand your personal issue and always treat you as slave.if you are stuck with some projects, forget getting release and you have to leave techM as last option.Lot of politics and language, state based groups which makes decision on stuffs without seeing merits and hard work.Management is pretty lazy and they never do any ground work, just give you false promises.Hike is very less and you get hike based on your relationship and sources inside management. You will be promoted only if you have good repo with managers.","Dear TechM management, please run a check on management issues and fire some lazy managers. You won't believe, people are surviving doing excel copy paste job for whole day. are you really hiring them for that work? Wake up before it's too late and people of TechM stop believing anymore in management and leave.",Former Employee - Senior Software Engineer,I worked at Tech Mahindra full-time (More than 5 years),https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Tech-Mahindra-RVW14111013.htm,3,1,1,3,1

This time it was a long term struggle to get a project. Resource Manager even dint help me this time. After a month of bench got a call from HR to put down my papers forcefully as per corporate decision and cost cutting jus giving me 4-5days time. Then continued my struggle to keep my job in hand.

Was jobless for 15-20days to bag an offer from one of the fortune 100 companies and top 100 best companies to work for. This is how I proved them.

Work here is of secondary outsourced type which probably does not need good technical knowledge. You may loose your technical touch if you stuck with this company for long. Avg. Salary hike is 3% per year. Appraisals are conducted per 1.5 years.Be aware .. You are not allowed to change project for 2.5 years even if you don't like it. So it's total risk if you don't get good project. Carrier will be on toss.No gifts, no perks, no parties or no other extra benefits. Please read offer letter carefully before joining.I recommend joining tech m should be your last option. We have most of the projects in support with outdated Technologies.

No work culture. Managers are like Hitler they will constantly look onto your system whenever they roam to your work desk. If any employee will would take tea brake with another team mates at pentry then If manager watched that he will surly ask ""Bhaiya Kaam Nahi Hai Kya"" or If after long working hours if some one doing some gossping with another team mates again manager will ask ""Bhaiya Kaam Nahi Kya"" which is the worst thing I faced in this company.2. One more bad policy is you have to complete 9:30 Hrs in the campus including 9 hrs on System for this tracking there is Software in every System which will calculate each day of your timing on system. If you spend less than a min from 9 hrs they will surly deduct your salary of half day.3. If you took lunch for 1 hr again manager will ask you complete your lunch in 20 Mins only , Hah I can't Imagine manager will go this level of cheapness.4. No Outing for Team.5. No self morale & motivation6. Appraisal are the worst they will give you only 1 to 3% only.7. Salary is also very much less as compared to market standard.8. Timing is not flexible If you reach 1/2 hr late then again manager will warn you in arrogant way ""This is my last warning to you"".9. Onsite Opportunity, Only If you know how to butter your manager then this place is heaven for you. So for butternuts, this is the best place.10. My suggestion to all new joiners is ""Think again. Its better to remain at home and search for another company then joining this one.",Try to Replace Managers because manager who are long enough with your company they assumed company is now our private property so they do whatever their wishes with their subordinates.,Former Employee - Senior Software Engineer,I worked at Tech Mahindra full-time (More than a year),https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Tech-Mahindra-RVW7680713.htm,1,1,1,1,1

The company seems to have spent lavishly on infrastructure and facilities for sports activities.,"1. Unprofessional organization:Tech Mahindra is my 2nd organization. I have worked in Cognizant earlier for 5 years. When I compare the two organizations in the parameters of professionalism, I find Tech Mahindra lacking far behind. Most employees carry a 'sir' attitude towards their managers.2. Unfair Appraisals:From my experience, the appraisal here is only a formality. The organization may have an appraisal process in place but competencies within the organization do not follow the set process. I have not seen anyone insisting on the process of goal setting an evaluation of goals . It is solely based on the relationship between a manager and their subordinates (the yes sir attitude plays a major role here).3. Employees are not valued.This has clearly resulted in high attrition rate in the organization.4. Low Onsite salary:The Onsite salaries offered are among the lowest in the industry. I am originally from Mahindra Satyam. The Onsite salaries offered by Mahindra Satyam were much higher (>35%) when compared to Tech Mahindra.",1. Value your employees and keep them motivated.2.

The policies are not employee friendly at all, by any means. In fact, they are as bad as it can get.- 9 day Privilege leaves (PL) were reduced. There is no concept of sick leave. It has to be adjusted against PL. If you are sick and have not filled your time sheets on time or applied for leave then you will lose pay for those days. They will not be adjusted against your existing PL balances.- Mandatory working hours were increased by 1.5 hour every day to 9.5 hours. When I left TechM, there was a rumour of making Saturdays working as well.-Hikes will be delayed by 4 to 6 months, always. Last year the employees were given either a no hike or a hike in between 2% - 6 %.The senior leadership will make it a point to brag about their generosity on this ridiculous hike.-Micro management at every level.The employees are monitored at every level right from the time one enters office till the time he/she leaves. It starts with a thumb impression/swipe card at the entry point first, then system first log in & last log out time. Lesser of the two is considered. This needs to tally with the time sheet entry or you will be eligible for a loss of pay, in case of any discrepancy which doesn't have your manager's approval.- Internet access is restricted and individual system key strokes are monitored & logged & maintained to determine productivity .-Employee performance feedback will be given and there is a use less mechanism in place to raise your grievance which will be chaired by a panel of deaf people.- Projects needs to be sourced by personal contacts as the resource management group is hopeless. People once allocated in a project will have to quit the company to change the project. If you are on bench then chances of your survival in the company will be very less.- My offer letter had fixed pay but the policy was changed later and a variable was introduced at the same annual pay. My monthly take home decreased due to this.- Employee retention bonus paid out after 5 years of service was slashed from 40k to 5k.- Freshers are expected to sign a bond of 2 years of continuous service or 2 Lacs rupees payout in case of breach of agreement.-Promotions are given to satisfy the employee but no raise is given. After the merger they are bringing the TG4 grade employees to TG3 grade employees.- Need less to say the above mentioned points will affect the working styles,attitude of the long timers in Tech Mahindra.

There are not many development projects and as a fresher, they dont give you an option or consider your skills while allocating you to a project. The bottom level HRs are quite friendly and good. But their managers or higher HRs behave very unethically and they literally threaten freshers. Freshers are especially bullied by these people whenever there they are forced to move or relocate to another location for the project, even though the fresher is not able to do so due to various reasons. They have a lot of other candidates who are willing to relocate for a particular project, but these guys will not give you any option of switching with them. I was literally told to accept or else i'll be fired. I had completed their ELITE training with a very good score and thought that I would make a good career in Tech Mahindra, but I had to quit because of this reason.","Tech Mahindra has lost a very good and dedicated employee, and who knows how many others have quit for the same reason.

They never get the process of appraisal done in time and that's very frustrating. Plus even while the company is making profits, the average appraisal is very depressing and low.The infrastructure is poor with cheap materials used. One good strong monsoon can bring the truth of the materials used in the buildings. This was my experience at their hinjewadi office in Pune.When it comes to onsite opportunities, skills and talent is given the last priority to select the deserving candidates. Other qualities like his/her personal rapport with the manager or visa ready resource( that also includes visa ready people from different projects) is considered the most.",Top management should pay attention to the grass root level problems. The main concerns is most of the managers are of old school and highly orthodox who are not open to the new ideas of doing things. Also some of the senior managers makes the professional work environment very personal and difficult for those who run them the wrong way. Appraisals should be addressed in the time effective and efficient manner. A lot of groups at the project manager and higher level where the employee is left alone and no one from senior management pays attention to him/her issues.,Former Employee - Junior Infrastructure Management Associate,I worked at Tech Mahindra full-time (More than 3 years),https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Tech-Mahindra-RVW5883785.htm,2,1,3,2,1
